// BlackJack Game Pseudocode

// 1. The game will consist of two players - player and dealer. 

// 2. There will be three buttons, one at the top of the page that begins the game, and two 
// side by side at the bottom that will read 'Stay' and 'Hit Me'

// 3. After pressing the 'Begin button, the player and dealer will both be randomly dealt
// two cards of a 52-card deck, with four suites of 13 cards (2-10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace).

// 4. The player must then decide whether to press the 'Hit Me' or 'Stay' buttons. Hit me will
// solicite another random card being drawn from the deck.

// 5. If the total value of the player's cards happens to total 21, the player wins.

// 6. There must be game logic incorporated that will determine the 'choice' of the dealer 
// whether to 'Stay' or 'Hit Me'. 

// 7. If either the player or dealer chooses 'Hit Me' and the card value totals exceed 21, 
// they will 'Bust' and automatically lose the game.

// 8. In the event that both the dealer and player 'Stay', the winner will be the player 
// with the highest card count, as long as it is not exceeding 21.
