 ####Game Directions:

1. The game consists of two players - player and dealer. The goal is to get your hand as close to 21 as possible without             'busting' ie going over 21. 

2. Press the 'Begin Game' button to start playing. 

3. You and dealer are both dealt two cards, with the dealer's first card face down.

4. You must decide whether to select 'Hit Me!' to add another card to your hand, or 'Stay' to keep the hand as is.

5. If you hit and your hand exceeds 21, you bust and automatically lose the game. 

6. Once you decide to stay, it's then the dealer's turn to decide whether to hit or stay.

7. Once the dealer's choice is made, the total values of each hand will be compared, and whoever has the closest total to 21         without going over wins the game.

    Note: the value of ace can either be 1 or 11, depending on what will suit your hand best.
